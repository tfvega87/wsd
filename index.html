    <h2><a id="About">About Raymond Ayala</a></h2>
    <section>
      <p>Ramón "Raymond" Luis Ayala Rodríguez (born February 3, 1977), 
       known artistically as Daddy Yankee, is a Latin Grammy Award winning Puerto Rican
       Reggaeton recording artist. Ayala was born in Río Piedras, the largest district of San Juan, 
       where he became interested in music at a young age. In his youth he was interested in baseball, 
       and aspired to become a Major League Baseball player. He was unable to continue this sport when 
       he received an injury to one of his legs, leaving him unable to walk correctly. He then became 
       involved in the underground rap movement that was in its early stages in Puerto Rico, later to 
       be called <strong>Reggaeton</strong>. After receiving lessons from several artists within the genre, he developed 
       an independent career, first recording in a production titled Playero 37. After this he began to 
       produce independent albums. His first solo album was <em>No Mercy</em>. He subsequently formed a duo with 
       Nicky Jam, and then continued his solo career with the releases of <em>El Cartel</em> and <em>El Cartel II</em>. 
       This led him be one of many pioneers of the reggaeton genre.</p>
       
       <p> 2002 <em>El Cangri.com</em> became Ayala's first album with international success, receiving coverage
        in the markets of New York and Miami. <em>Barrio Fino</em> was released in 2004, and the album received numerous 
        awards, including a <strong>Premio Lo Nuestro</strong> and a <strong>Latin Billboard</strong>, as well as receiving nominations for the 
        <strong>Latin Grammy</strong> and <strong>MTV Video Music Awards</strong>. <em>Barrio Fino</em> performed well in the sales charts of the United States,
        Latin America, Europe, and Japan. On June 5, 2007, El Cartel Records released El Cartel: The Big Boss, which 
        was ranked as the top-selling album in Latin music genres in 2007. He promoted the album with an international 
        tour which began in the United States and continued through Latin America, breaking attendance records in 
        Ecuador and Bolivia. His performances have appeared on more than 70 albums, including compilations such as 
        <em>Mas Flow 2</em> and <em>Blin Blin Vol. 1</em>. Outside of his work as a musician, Ayala has also worked as an actor and 
        producer. Throughout his career, he has been generally reticent to discuss his personal life, but has publicly 
        expressed the importance of his wife and children to him.</p>
        
      <p>Ayala married <em>Mireddys González</em> when he was seventeen years old. The couple have three children: <em>Yamilet</em>,
         <em>Jeremy</em> and <em>Jesairis</em>. Throughout his career Ayala has kept most of his personal life private, rarely speaking
         about it in interviews. He has said that he avoids doing so because such details are the only aspect of his 
         life that are not public and that they are like a "little treasure". He made an exception in 2006 when he spoke
         about his relationship with his wife and children in an interview with María Celeste Arrarás in <strong>Al Rojo Vivo</strong>. 
         He stated that his marriage is strong because he and his wife are "friends above anything", adding that he has 
         tried to ignore other temptations because "weakness is the reason for the downfall of several artists." He also 
         described his "very close" communication with his children, in which he tries to offer advice against drugs and 
         negative influences. His first daughter was born when he was eighteen years old, which he has described as 
         confusing at first, adding that raising a daughter at that age was a hard experience.</p>
