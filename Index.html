    <h2>About Raymond Ayala</h2>
      <p>Ramón "Raymond" Luis Ayala Rodríguez (born February 3, 1977), 
       known artistically as Daddy Yankee, is a Latin Grammy Award winning Puerto Rican
       Reggaeton recording artist. Ayala was born in Río Piedras, the largest district of San Juan, 
       where he became interested in music at a young age. In his youth he was interested in baseball, 
       and aspired to become a Major League Baseball player. He was unable to continue this sport when 
       he received an injury to one of his legs, leaving him unable to walk correctly. He then became 
       involved in the underground rap movement that was in its early stages in Puerto Rico, later to 
       be called Reggaeton. After receiving lessons from several artists within the genre, he developed 
       an independent career, first recording in a production titled Playero 37. After this he began to 
       produce independent albums. His first solo album was No Mercy. He subsequently formed a duo with 
       Nicky Jam, and then continued his solo career with the releases of El Cartel and El Cartel II. 
       This led him be one of many pioneers of the reggaeton genre.</P>
